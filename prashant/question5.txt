How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.
Setting Multiple Remotes for the Same Project
You can add multiple remotes using git remote add. This allows pushing and pulling from different repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or a backup server).

Steps:
Add a primary remote (e.g., origin):

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <primary-remote-url>
Add a secondary remote (e.g., backup):

bash
Copy code
git remote add backup <secondary-remote-url>
Verify remotes:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
Push to a specific remote:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
git push backup main
Use Case:
Team Collaboration: Work on GitHub as the primary repository and use GitLab as a backup.
Multi-platform Projects: Host the same codebase on different services for redundancy or client-specific workflows.
