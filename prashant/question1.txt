1. What happens when a file is deleted in the main branch and updated in a feature branch, and how is this handled during a merge?

When merging, Git detects a conflict because the file is deleted in the main branch but modified in the feature branch.

Resolution:
During the merge, Git prompts you to resolve the conflict.
You decide whether to:
Keep the deletion (remove the file), or
Retain and merge the updates from the feature branch.
This can be done manually or with a merge tool. After resolving, commit the changes to complete the merge.
